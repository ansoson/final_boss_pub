Jack Playtests for Final II (Nov "28" submission)

What I told people:
-our controls (because we haven't made an instructions page as of my current push, 58363dc)

What I didn't tell them:
-what anything signified

Didn't talk at all during playthrough until they quit, at time noted in each playthrough I then helped them if they were stuck
just so I could get feedback on a few more features.

Playtest 1: Charles Effman

He plays Paper Mario, so he's a little bit of a gamer. Notes are as follows:
- "Who are they" (about white spots in field-- "cracks" between tiles). Was upset when it was evidently "fixed" next go around.
- Confused about spawning offscreen
- Attack went wrong way while running, Charlie noted that it felt unintuitive to have to "run at him, stop, then attack".
- He couldn't see the sprites on the logs at all, save for the rope and net, and after a while noticed the shield.
- Noticed some weapons had weird cooldown-- especially the fishing rod. The net was fine though.
- "I can't read this at all " about the payout page.
- Boss died quicker on re-fights, until single attacks were soloing it. He then tried to recreate it and it didn't happen.
  Visibly confused by this.
- Bubbles "remained on field" (his justification for why boss was being soloed... look into this?)

Playtest 2: Nadia Bishop

Self described "not a gamer".

- Also got lost in the first spawn-in on battle view.
- Spammed buttons despite having no weapons, since missed weapons. Died.
- Totally ignored weapons.
(I proceeded to explain weapons.)
- She couldn't understand rope or shield with their current menu sprites.
- "Wow"
- Confusion over boss head not being hittable
- "What's with the shaded HP bar? Why does he have that"
- very excited about watering can, laughed
- "I like the little guy"

Both were enthused by the game and expressed wanting to try again when we had patched bugs.

Anthony Playtests Final II (Nov "28" submission)

- Liked items, thought they were fun
